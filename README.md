# JMeterSoapSampler
JMeter Soap Sampler with support to attachments
It needs to be put in the lib/ext folder inside the JMeter that is run. It supports multiple attachments, both SOAP protocols. It also is showing the response attachments in view resuls tree-> sampler sub-results. So that appropriate assertion can be made on the attachments, assuming that the attachments are pure in pure text.
